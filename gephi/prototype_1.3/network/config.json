    "intro": "This Network Map is a prototype application developed by team Neural Nerds at UTS (iLab2) in partnership with the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and University of Melbourne – Centre for Health Policy.\n\nThe label consists of [the total amount] Entiry Name - [Entity Type]\n\nThe size of node (circle) represents the total donation amount where applicable which helps identify key donors. (Equals 1 where the donation amount is not applicable).\n\nOptions available in the Group Selector represent entity types.\nGroup 1 – Lobbying Firm\nGroup 2 - Corporation\nGroup 3 - Individual\nGroup 4 - Agent for state candidate\nGroup 5 - Lobbyist\nGroup 6 - Other\nGroup 7 – Trust/Foundation\nGroup 8 – State Candidate\nGroup 9 – Unincorporated Association\n",
